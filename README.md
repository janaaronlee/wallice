# wallice
An opinionated AWS Lambda web framework built on top of the wonderful [Chalice][https://github.com/aws/chalice].

## Usage
Check out the [wallice-starter][https://github.com/janaaronlee/wallice-starter] project for a sneak peak.

## Why yet another serverless framework?
This framework seeks to provide more usability over the already great Chalice microframework. The goal is to keep _this_ framework as _lean_ as possible, while making it easier to prototype and develop _human-friendly_ web applications. A modular approach is planned as more features / integrations are added.

## Support
If you encounter any issues or suggestions, please file an issue [here][https://github.com/janaaronlee/wallice/issues].
